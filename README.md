Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Saanya Khanna, a budding enthusiast in the realm of Business Computer Information Systems with a keen interest in data engineering. Let me share a bit about my coding journey.

# About Me
I'm a motivated and detail-oriented student currently pursuing a degree in Business Computer Information Systems at the University of North Texas. My journey into the world of coding began with curiosity in High School, and since then, I've been exploring the exciting intersection of technology and business.

# Current Focus
Currently, I'm diving into the world of data engineering with an associate-level certification. Although my coding experience is in its early stages, I bring a strong analytical mindset, design thinking, and a growing proficiency in Python and SQL to the table.

# GitHub Presence
GitHub serves as my learning ground, where you'll find a couple of Python and SQL projects and, as my skills evolve, more contributions in data engineering. I believe in the power of learning in public, and my repositories are a reflection of my commitment to continuous improvement.

# Learning and Growing
With only a couple of projects under my belt, I'm actively pursuing opportunities to enhance my coding skills. Currently working on an associate-level data engineering certification, I'm excited about the possibilities that data holds and the role I can play in shaping its narrative.

# Let's Connect!
Thank you for stopping by! If you have advice, or resources, or just want to connect, I'd love to hear from you. Let's grow and learn together in the vast and fascinating world of data and technology.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
