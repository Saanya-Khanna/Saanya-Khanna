# Hello, World! 👋
Hi there! I'm Saanya Khanna, an aspiring Information Systems professional with a passion for data analysis, market research, and lead generation. Currently based in Arlington, Texas, I'm pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Information Systems at the University of Texas, Arlington.

# 🌟 About Me

My journey into the tech world began in high school, and I've since developed a keen interest in how data can drive business decisions. With hands-on experience in market research, data entry, and project management, I'm constantly looking to expand my technical skills and contribute to impactful projects.

# 💻 Current Focus

Right now, I’m diving deep into data engineering and data analysis, with a particular focus on Python and SQL. My recent externships and internships have allowed me to apply these skills in real-world scenarios, from analyzing AI risks to managing lead generation processes. I’m also working towards a certification in data engineering to further solidify my technical expertise.

# 🚀 GitHub Projects

GitHub is my playground for learning and growth. Here, you’ll find:
- Python scripts that explore data visualization techniques.
- SQL projects where I integrate and analyze datasets, such as factors influencing the U.S. housing market.
- As I continue to grow, I plan to add more projects that reflect my journey in data engineering and beyond.

# 📚 Learning Journey

I'm a firm believer in learning by doing, and GitHub reflects my commitment to continuous improvement. With a solid academic background and practical experience, I’m eager to tackle new challenges and explore innovative solutions in the data realm. My next goal is to dive deeper into data engineering and contribute to meaningful projects that make an impact.
